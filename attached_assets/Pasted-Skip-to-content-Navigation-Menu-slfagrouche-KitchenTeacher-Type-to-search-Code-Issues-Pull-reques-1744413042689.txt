KitchenTeacher
KitchenTeacher is an interactive web application that predicts dishes from food images, provides YouTube recipe videos, and fetches detailed recipe instructions. This project utilizes Gradio for the user interface and leverages Hugging Face's model inference capabilities for dish prediction.

Features
Dish Prediction: Upload an image of a food item, and KitchenTeacher will predict the dish using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
YouTube Recipe Videos: Once the dish is predicted, KitchenTeacher fetches YouTube recipe videos related to the predicted dish, allowing users to explore different recipes.
Detailed Recipe Instructions: Additionally, KitchenTeacher fetches detailed recipe instructions from TheMealDB API, providing users with step-by-step instructions and ingredient lists.
