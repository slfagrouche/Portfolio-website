🔧 Core Issues to Fix (Based on Screenshots & Your Notes)
1. Color & Visual Tone
Current issue: Dark brown + harsh contrast + heavy gradients = feels heavy and outdated.

What to change:

Use lighter beige or soft neutral backgrounds (e.g., warm cream, soft sand, linen tones).

Ditch the dark background for a light theme with minimal shadows.

Reduce visual noise—aim for subtle shadows, clean borders, and gentle hover effects.

2. Too Much Text / Cramped Feel
Current issue: Sections are text-heavy and word-dense; feels like a resume copy-paste.

What to change:

Cut down word count by 30–50%.

Keep one strong sentence per idea, and let visuals breathe.

Use bullet points, white space, and icons to show rather than tell.

3. Disconnected Sections
Current issue: Sections feel like isolated blocks instead of a smooth scroll experience.

What to change:

Use fluid transitions between sections—soft dividers, scroll-based motion, or background shifts.

Add a thin horizontal line or a soft gradient change between sections to guide the eye.

Consider sticky nav or section anchors for smoother navigation.

4. Font + Typography
Current issue: Current font feels formal; not modern/founder-vibe.

What to change:

Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Inter, Satoshi, or Plus Jakarta Sans).

Add slight font-size variation between sections to build hierarchy.

Don’t bold too much — use weight + spacing intentionally.

5. Visual Hierarchy
Current issue: Everything fights for attention; hard to know what’s most important.

What to change:

Highlight 1–2 things per section only (use cards, spacing, or hover reveals).

Make call-to-actions (CTAs) stand out with color contrast and spacing.

6. “Cool Founder” Style Add-ons
Add soft animation when sections scroll in (Framer Motion-style).

Add a one-liner at the top that’s punchy and memorable — e.g.,
“Building tools that scale ideas into real impact.”

Add a hand-drawn or personal touch element — simple sketch, initials, or a fun footer message.

Include tiny personal detail in About or Contact, like a "currently reading" or "fav tool" badge.
