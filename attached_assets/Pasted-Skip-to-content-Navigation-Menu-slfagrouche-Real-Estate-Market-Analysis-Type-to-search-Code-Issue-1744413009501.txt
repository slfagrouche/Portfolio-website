Project Description
The analysis is based on a dataset containing over 2.2 million real estate listings across the United States. Key features include:

Property characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, living area)
Location data (city, state, zip code)
Price information
Property status (for sale, sold, ready to build)
Key Analysis Components:
Exploratory Data Analysis (notebooks/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_of_of_USA_Real_Estate_Properties.ipynb)

Statistical analysis of property characteristics
Distribution analysis of prices and features
Correlation analysis between variables
Geographical distribution of listings
High-Level Analysis (notebooks/High_level_analysis.ipynb)

Clustering Analysis
Identified 5 distinct market segments
Market segmentation insights
Statistical Tests
Chi-square tests for state-status relationships
ANOVA for price differences
T-tests for price comparisons
Linear Regression
Price prediction model
Feature importance analysis
Time Series Analysis
Price trends and patterns
Key Findings:
Significant price variations across different states and property statuses
Strong market segmentation with distinct property clusters
Dynamic market conditions in states like Texas, with high construction activity
Weak to moderate correlations between price and physical characteristics
