üéØ Why TUTOR is Different?
Traditional LLM applications often struggle with delivering accurate, context-aware answers. TUTOR leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine the power of large language models with a curated knowledge base.

Responses are not solely based on pre-trained data.
Answers are grounded in the specific content provided by the user (audio transcriptions or PDF text).
Enhanced accuracy and contextual relevance.
